Hello,

I am a fifth year research fellow working towards my PhD under the supervision of 
[Dr. Utpal Garain](https://www.isical.ac.in/~utpal/) at the 
Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit, ISI Kolkata.

My current research is focused on trying to inculcate key features of symbolic
AI techniques, like domain constraint awareness, logical coherence, etc., into
deep learning-based systems. Addition of logical constraints and pre-existing
knowledge not only makes these systems more deployable to critical applications
but also makes them more data efficient and performant. This problem shows up in
many domains and thus leads me to work in several fields like natural language,
medicine, biology, astrophysics and diverse business applications.
